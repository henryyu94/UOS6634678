        This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a
        heterogeneous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental
        improvement in accuracy, compared to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The
        strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets. We further consider an application to texture classification
        problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non- adaptive active learning and traditional machine learning
        approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that

        Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an intelligent
        machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A
        distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances
        from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to improve the classification model.
        Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation
        (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling)
        (Tong and Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they
        are presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class labels. After
        adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is subsequently induced. A goal of
        this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is
        continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected
        instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008)
